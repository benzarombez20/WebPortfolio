            For my soundscape narrative I wanted to do something that would subtly tell a story through sounds and sound effects. With the audacity tools I believed that it would be an appropriate challenge to try to do this without narration. The story I chose was the history of earth and the human race. I wanted my soundscape narrative to sound like the listener was traveling through time, from the prehistoric ages all the way to the modern day.
