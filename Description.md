## My Portfolio:


### I plan for my portfolio to consist of a main page with my contact and information, as well as a picture of myself. On the top of my page will be Tabs with pictures, these pictures will include links to the different pages on my website. One of those pages will be a Projects page where I will have a list of some of my coding projects. Another Tab will have My Work Experience/Leadership experience. And the final tab will be links to my resume and transcript along with maybe a reccomendation letter. Also I will include a link to my linked in page. I hope my website will present what I can offer an employer in a very organized and aethestically appealing fashion.
